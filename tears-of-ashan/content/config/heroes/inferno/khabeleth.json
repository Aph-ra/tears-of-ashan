Unlike other demons who constantly feed on scraps from their overlords, Kha-Beleth relies fully on his own resources, a trait which proves him a powerful figure in the complicated world of infernal politics. He makes no secret of what he wants: nothing less than destruction of the walls of Sheogh, and freedom for the children of Urgash. With his near-infinite patience, his fearlessness, his brilliant mind, and his charismatic manner, he may one day realise his lofty goals.",
