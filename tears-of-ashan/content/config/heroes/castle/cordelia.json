It is said that Cordelia is the only woman who has ever pierced the hard heart of the Great Inquisitor Salvatore – not through any womanly charms mind you, but rather via her uncompromising faith in Elrath, with which she has condemned many a heretic’s soul to a slow and gruesome death. For her accomplishments, Cordelia was tasked with keeping an eye on the Necromancers settling the Heresh Valley beyond the Scar. She couldn’t have dreamt of a better reward.",
