Instinctively grasping for a surer, faster form of power, Ludmilla found herself living a secret life as she fell in with a den of Necromancers who had great plans for the future. When one of their number, a lascivious Vampire, became her lover, she took to wearing a studded collar as a coded symbol of her blossoming rebellion - that or to cover the bite marks. It was only a matter of time before she took the ritual, and became a Vampire herself. Immortality is such a boon when you're a power-hungry sybarite.",
