She shares Sandro's goal of destroying all of creation, though she never truly understood his motivations and how dangerous the Void really is. Above all, she is attracted by the tremendous powers the Void offers to those who embrace it. She has met Vein before, though the magic of the Void has a tendency to distort memories. She is cold, calculating, and constantly drunk with her Void-fuelled powers.",
