It was Merikh who presided over the trial of the nefarious Nethermancer Sandro, banishing him from the Wizard lands. When Sandro returned, some sixty years later, he had not forgotten Merikh's role in his exile, and perpetrated his revenge by trapping his soul within a ghoul's body. It took Belketh several years and a great amount of power to track down the creature and salvage Merikh's essence, binding it to a more appropriate vessel: a black suit of armour. Relentless, unbendable and incorruptible, Merikh has become a terrifying embodiment of Justice.",
